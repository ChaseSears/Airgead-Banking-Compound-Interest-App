Project Summary and Reflections

Project Overview

This project involves developing an application in collaboration with Airgead Banking to teach high school students about fiscal responsibility, with a focus on the power of compound interest. The application provides an interactive system where users can input variables such as initial investment, interest rate, and investment duration to visualize how their investments will grow over time. The primary problem this project addresses is the lack of practical financial education tools available to students, particularly those that can demonstrate complex concepts like compound interest in an accessible and engaging way.

Achievements

One of the key successes in this project was designing a user-friendly interface that simplifies the input process.

Opportunities for Improvement

While the project was successful, there are areas where the code could be enhanced. For example, optimizing the algorithms for better performance when handling larger datasets would make the application more scalable. Enhancing security, such as by implementing more robust input validation and data encryption, would ensure that the application is safer for users.

Challenges and Solutions

The most challenging aspect of this project was accurately implementing the compound interest calculations and ensuring the results were displayed correctly for various user inputs. To overcome this, I used multiple testing scenarios to verify the accuracy of the calculations and consulted financial textbooks and online resources to validate the formulas. I also utilized debugging tools to step through the code and identify any logical errors.

Transferable Skills

The skills I developed during this project will be highly transferable to other coursework and future projects. These include a deeper understanding of financial concepts, particularly compound interest, as well as the ability to design and implement algorithms that perform complex calculations efficiently. My experience with developing user interfaces that are both functional and user-friendly will also be applicable in many other contexts.

Code Quality and Maintainability

To ensure that the code is maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I adhered to best practices such as using descriptive variable names, commenting thoroughly, and organizing the code into modular functions and classes.
